# Write a Deaf Grandma program. 
# Whatever you say to grandma(user input) she should respond 
# with HUH?!, SPEAK UP SONNY!, unless you shout it(type in all 
# CAPS).  If you shout, she can hear you and yells back NO, 
# NOT SINCE 1938! Grandma should shout a different year each time; 
# random between 1930 to 1980. You canâ€™t stop talking to 
# grandma until you shout BYE.
